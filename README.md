#IFV-Website

The New website for the Illini Film and Video club at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champiagn. 
This was a collaboration with a past IFV webmaster.

Index.html is the home page

login.html, members.html, and pastmembers.html are not finished.
These pages have been commmented out of the About page. 
When finished they will apear on the website.
members.html will be taken appart and changed to look more like the Events page. With round boxes for each member.

I was very busy during the time I was Webmaster, as a result the site, mainly the home page has bugs. One i particular where the videos slides don't stop when a video is played.

Good Luck Future IFV Webmaster!
